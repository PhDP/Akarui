# Installing

Manticore should compile with the ghc compiler versions 7.6, 7.8, and 7.10.

# Linux

Unless your Linux distribution is really old, it should have a recent enough
version of both the ghc compiler and cabal package management.

# Mac OSX

# Windows

The [Haskell platform](https://www.haskell.org/platform/) contains all the
necessary tools to compile Manticore. Simply open a command prompt and type

    cabal install

...and the root of Manticore's source.
