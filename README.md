# Sphinx
[![Build status](https://travis-ci.org/PhDP/Sphinx-AI.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/PhDP/Sphinx-AI)

Hybrid logic/probabilistic machine learning library.

It's a hybrid and it answers queries: I **had** to name it *Sphinx*.

## How to...

Sphinx uses cabal for building ('cabal build'), generating the doc ('cabal
haddock') and launching the tests ('cabal test'). It has a pretty small
set of dependencies to avoid cabal hell.
