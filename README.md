# Manticore
[![Build status](https://travis-ci.org/PhDP/Manticore.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/PhDP/Manticore)

Hybrid logic/probabilistic machine learning library.

It's a hybrid and it answers queries: it **had** to be named *Sphinx*... but
there's already a package with this name in hackage, so another mythological
creature, the manticore, would have to do. It's a hybrid and it rhymes with
'multicore'.

## How to...

Manticore uses cabal for building ('cabal build'), generating the doc ('cabal
haddock') and launching the tests ('cabal test'). It has a pretty small
set of dependencies to avoid cabal hell.
