# Sphinx

Hybrid logic/probabilistic machine learning library.

It's a hybrid and it answers queries: it had to be named Sphinx.

## How to...

Sphinx uses cabal for building ('cabal build'), generating the doc ('cabal
haddock') and launching the tests ('cabal test'). It has a pretty small
set of dependencies to avoid cabal hell.
